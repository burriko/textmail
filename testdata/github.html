<p>There are millions of projects on GitHub. Every day, people from around the world are working to make these projects better. Opening issues, pushing code, submitting Pull Requests, discussing project details â€” GitHub activity is a papertrail of progress. Have you ever wondered what all that data looks like? There are millions of stories to tell; you just have to look.</p>

<p>Last year we held our <a href="https://github.com/blog/1118-the-github-data-challenge">first data challenge</a>.
We saw <a href="https://github.com/blog/1162-github-data-challenge-winners">incredible visualizations, interesting timelines and compelling analysis</a>.</p>

<p>What stories will be told this year? It's up to you!</p>

<h2>Data access</h2>

<p>The GitHub public timeline is a featured public dataset available on <a href="https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/">Google BigQuery</a>. The "timeline" table has over a year's worth of public activity and is approaching 100M rows. You can find even more data available in JSON format on <a href="http://www.githubarchive.org/">The GitHub Archive project</a>.</p>

<p>You are free to use any tools you like. If you choose to use BigQuery, running queries against the GitHub dataset is free for the first 100GB of query processing. Pricing information for additional query processing is <a href="https://developers.google.com/bigquery/pricing#table">available here</a>. After <a href="https://developers.google.com/bigquery/sign-up">signing up for BigQuery</a>, add the project name "githubarchive".</p>
